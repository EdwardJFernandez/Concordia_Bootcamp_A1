            Woody, Buzz Lightyear and the rest of the gang embark on a road trip
            with Bonnie and a new toy named Forky. The adventurous journey turns
            into an unexpected reunion as Woody's slight detour leads him to his
            long-lost friend Bo Peep. As Woody and Bo discuss the old days, they
            soon start to realize that they're two worlds apart when it comes to
            what they want from life as a toy.

                  He is a vintage cowboy doll that originally belonged to a boy
                  named Andy Davis. As Andy's favorite since kindergarten, Woody
                  served as the leader of Andy's toys, a position he upheld by
                  looking out for each member of the group. When Andy enters

                  girl named Bonnie Anderson. He remains with Bonnie for some

                  to helping lost toys find owners, alongside his girlfriend Bo

                  Bo is the romantic interest (later girlfriend) of Woody,
                  providing a calm and loving comfort whenever he is
                  overwhelmed. She is noted for using her shepherdess crook to
                  hook her cowboy and bring him closer in a romantic way. In
                  private, she is a great deal more daring with her words and
                  actions, which Woody seems to be quite fond of. She and her
                  sheep were bought along with the lamp not too long after Molly
                  was born, due to the baby being scared of the dark, which
                  "broke every toy's heart", according to Woody. The lamp
                  comforted Molly and she would often have her hand lay on Bo's
                  feet.
